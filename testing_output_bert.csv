57,"it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent "" fargo , "" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; "" blood simple "" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end .",2,2
58,"to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening .",1,1
59,"every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the "" big picture "" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person .",2,2
60,"this aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film .",2,2
61,"for one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder .",0,2
62,"and although they at least didnÃµt have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes .",0,1
63,"blood simple "" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner .",2,2

73,"admittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line .",2,2
74,"sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters .",2,2
75,"having said that , i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the "" fake "" jackal met with the "" real "" jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre .",2,2

77,"like a lot of action movies , there's a climax where everyone's shooting at everyone else -- but in this case , it's played as a tongue-in-cheek piece of black comedy instead of a serious contest of strength . """,1,2
78,"he tries to rob a bank , but even that collapses when he realizes he's left his face mask at hime -- and the only mask he can find at the corner convenience store ( in a hilarious piece of montage ) is a children's-sized job .",1,1

80,"there is a kind of a nod to the parallel-reality jaunting of "" lola "" -- in one screamingly funny scene , the three runners jog past a pretty young woman , and each of them entertains varied pornographic fantasies about her .",2,2
81,"twentyfourseven "" is a strong character picture , and could not have succeeded without excellent performances by hoskins , in his most complex role yet , and a strong supporting cast of relative newcomers led by danny nussbaum as tim .",2,2
82,"when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist .",1,1
83,"at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within "" scream "" has now become totally fictional .",1,1
84,"three different scripts were penned , weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the "" scream "" 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read .",1,1
85,"still , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fear of becoming what her mother wasÃ¢â‚¬'or , at least , what her mother was secretly .",1,1
86,"when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through "" woodsboro , "" written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of "" scream 3 "" Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s finest moments .",2,1
87,"no , i donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the ghostface costume or the directorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said "" dramatic element "" ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with "" scream "" .",2,1
88,"some critics have noted that "" scream 3 "" seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true ironyÃ¢â‚¬'maybe even a little bit of satireÃ¢â‚¬'if the film worked in a few more clichÃ£Â©s .",2,2
89,"it does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying .",1,2
90,"if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton-chop sideburns to each side of his head , spoken with a thick irish accent , and tried his damnedest to play it straight , he wouldn't have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in "" i went down . """,1,1

92,"mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that , but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies , most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity , "" the butcher boy . """,1,2
93,"that film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson's tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully-crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that'll make you laugh out loud .",2,2
94,"a deranged scientist ( michael canton ) rescues marvin from the wreckage , rebuilds his body robocop-style with animal parts ( refugees from a traveling mexican circus ) , and marvin's newfound animal instincts naturally kick into full effect when he's released back into the general population .",1,1
95,"marvin meets and falls in love with the chick from the first season of survivor ( colleen haskell ) , uses his extra-keen sense of smell to sniff out drugs from perpetrators' rectal areas , rescues a drowning boy flipper-style , consumes enough slim jims to keep macho man randy savage happy , humps a mailbox , and tries to make sweet love to a goat in heat .",1,1

98,"i suppose i must , however , try to respond to some of the charges that have been levelled at rozema's picture , which has become notorious among austen purists ( some of whom may even have seen it ) .",1,1
99,"from my ignorant point of view , this makes perfect sense : since fanny's environment prevents her from shouting out her thoughts , and a movie cannot contain a narration telling us what's going on in her head , we understand her feelings through what she writes .",1,2
100,"sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr .",1,1
101,"there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) .",2,1
102,"by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters .",2,2

104,"a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation .",1,1

109,"eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex .",2,2
110,"it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year ) .",2,2
111,"then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other .",1,1

208,"the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ?",0,1

212,"the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land .",2,2

216,"at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang .",1,1

352,"the movie is liberally sprinkled with clever in-jokes ( the chess-playing geezer from pixar's oscar-winning short 'geri's game' shows up in a cameo ) , referential gags ( post-sputnik 'space toys' are derided , and the riffs on star wars happen early and often ) , and hilarious one-liners that will fly right over the heads of the sprogs while getting big laughs from their parents .",2,2
353,"better still , disney's recent trend away from musical numbers has left toy story 2 with only two : a lovely but depressing sarah mclachlan tear-jerker and a rehash of randy newman's "" you've got a friend in me "" from the first film .",2,1
354,"obviously , the computer graphics are much improved ( check out the trees and the family dog's highly realistic coat ) , but the truly remarkable achievement is that after a while , you stop noticing them and focus instead on the characters .",2,2

358,"capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him .",1,1
359,"unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed .",0,1
360,"the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) .",1,1
361,"oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us .",0,1

363,"palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters .",1,2
364,"played by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role .",2,2
365,"com/plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place .",1,1
366,"in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer .",2,2
367,"that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all .",2,2
368,"i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members .",2,2
369,"it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) .",2,1
370,"just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances .",1,2
371,"in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans .",2,2
372,"until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies .",1,1
373,"the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood .",2,2
374,"ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of "" new hollywood "" generation of young movie authors who made "" artsy "" and "" personal "" films in early 1970s .",1,1

376,"on the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress .",1,2
377,"on the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) .",2,1
378,"the others would find the author's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes .",2,2
379,"we have a "" coming-of-age "" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters .",1,2
380,"unfortunately , the same can't be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career .",0,1
381,"however , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren't the most remembered trademark of the movie .",2,2

394,"and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever .",2,1
395,"it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close ) .",0,0

397,"woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead .",0,1
398,"much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation .",0,2
399,"his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him .",0,1

401,"as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film .",1,1
402,"after griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is "" polymorphously perverse "" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of "" la dolce vita . """,2,2
403,"his story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status .",1,2
404,"and , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they'd never look at him the same way .",2,2
405,"he ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him .",2,1
406,"but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it's a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it's still a smart and insightful film .",2,2
407,"though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it'd be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness .",1,2
408,"it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen's oeuvre , it's merely a blip ( no "" annie hall "" but it's no "" shadows and fog "" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice .",2,2
409,"this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere , with a very creepy insane asylum ( in which most of the film takes place ) , very few clues up-front and lots to talk about afterwards .",2,2

577,"in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a "" saturday night live "" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious .",2,2
578,"first we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he's been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) .",1,1

580,"many years later , and after a succession of memorable owners ( gena rowlands , cheech marin , and jay mohr ) , paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in los angeles trying to steal jewelry .",1,1
581,"actually , paulie is the voice of jay mohr ( he played jennifer aniston's boyfriend on picture perfect ) doing his best buddy hackett impression ( which is interesting , since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner , and mohr doubles as a customer ) .",2,1
582,"sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads , but i'm sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person ( paulie ) trying to get home , meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way .",2,2

""",1,1
584,"john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline .",2,1
585,"but even trash tv topicality can't drag "" wild things "" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast .",2,1
586,"high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent .",2,2
587,"hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped .",1,1
588,"before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .",1,1
589,"while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her .",0,1
590,"a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off .",2,2
591,"and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell .",2,2
592,"speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in "" starship troopers . """,1,1
593,"to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty .",1,1
594,"although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it .",1,2
595,"yes , that's right , one of those people who religiously collects japanese animation by methods of sometimes dubious legality , huddles in dark screening rooms at science-fiction conventions to get my "" fix , "" complains prodigiously about dubs ( especially those from streamline ) , and is probably looked upon rather oddly by most of the people i know because of it .",1,1
596,"even though totoro is touted as a children's movie ( and a very good children's movie it is , too ) , is is a film that will likely enthrall and at the very least not bore ( or , for that matter , nauseate--barney , anyone ? )",2,2
597,"for example , in both laputa : castle in the sky and an episode of the "" lupin "" tv series that he directed , a robot is featured that looks remarkably similar to one from a 1930s fleischer superman short .",1,1
598,"as this is a children's movie , it was to be expected that the music would be translated into english , and i was half-expecting some sort of stupid kiddie song that would be entirely unrelated to the spirit of the original .",0,1
599,"there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments .",2,2
600,"when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as "" america's sweetheart "" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile .",2,2
601,"while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game .",2,2

603,"when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work .",0,1
604,"our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film .",1,2
605,"to convince her that he's the man for the job , chance fights away some homeless thugs looking to rip natalie ( the daughter , played by yancy butler ) off of a few hundred dollars , using his fists and feet to crush bones like nothing you've ever seen in a van damme movie before .",1,1
606,"director john woo uses techniques--like slow-mo , quick-cut , and freeze frame--that other directors have either taken for granted or have been too afraid to use , and creates an entirely new kind of action movie that most american audiences have never seen before .",2,2

608,"whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology .",2,2
609,"for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of "" agents "" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather .",1,1
610,"the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise .",2,2
611,"easily the most anticipated , most delayed film release of 1997 , james cameron's $220 million "" titanic "" steams into theaters with a slew of questions to answer , most notably was it worth the wait , the hype , and all that money ?",1,1
612,"the size and scope of the production are evidenced by a massive , detailed replica of the white star liner , impressive visual effects , countless extras , and a love story transcending the atlantic ocean itself .",2,2
613,"cameron paints the haves and the have-nots a little too black and white--the rich are all stuffy , boring snots while the poor are the only ones who really know how to have fun--but on the darker side , billy zane is particularly good as rose's suave , callous fiancÃ© cal hockley .",1,2
614,"time skips by quickly , and there are more than a few decent supporting performances to enjoy , including frances fisher ( as rose's disapproving mother ruth ) and bernard hill , in an underwritten role as the ship's ineffectual captain .",2,1
615,"paxton ) has one of his staff explain , via a fascinating computer animation , how the ship went down in the icy waters of the north atlantic , sending 1 , 500 of its 2 , 200 passengers and crew to their deaths .",0,1
616,"starting with a moody grass-scape of what turns out to be a quiet corner of central park , voiced-over by allen's `z' , a hapless worker ant who feels the weight of the colony--so to speak--on his back , antz tracks a lot like any allen flick .",1,1
617,"instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city .",1,1
618,"editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory .",2,2

623,"although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it .",2,2

627,"in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) .",1,1
628,"meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled "" stab "" , which has been developed into a major motion picture .",1,1
629,"as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of "" stab "" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria .",0,1
630,"of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies .",2,2
631,"this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities .",1,2
632,"it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work .",2,2
633,"the chamber , adapted from the john grishamn novel , starts off as a typical legal-thriller-with-a-twist , but then slowly turns into a different sort of story , about one man trying to find the truth about the past and another man trying to find the truth about himself .",1,1
634,"as the movie unwound , i felt it could have gone one of two ways : either it could have developed the plot to the point where the human story became more irrelevant and therefore could be resolved with a mechanical flourish ( the way the dreadful a time to kill ended up ) , or it could pay closer attention to the people in the story .",1,1
635,"and be warned : as a result , we don't get a nice , tidy conclusion -- a lot of threads are left dangling , probably deliberately , since the real conclusion of the movie is in the way hackman's character handles his oncoming fate .",1,1
636,"eventually we see that his racism is not so much a philosophy as a way of warding off terrible grief and hurt , and self-hatred ( as is the case with most virulently racist people , they compensate violently for not having what they feel should be simply given to them gratis ) .",1,1
637,"hall ( played by chris o'donnell with maturity and grace ) also has a transformation of his own , but a smaller one : sometimes it's not possible to use the law as a way to repair what has gone wrong , just to comment on it .",1,2
638,"he resents his grandfather for using the same tired excuses , but at the same time batters patiently at the man's defenses , knowing that it's only a matter of time before the imminence of the clock will get him to say something true to his heart .",1,1
639,"stephen soderbergh's "" erin brockovich "" is a brilliant story of anger turning into courtroom skills ; a david versus goliath-style exposÃ© in the great tradition of "" silkwood "" , "" a civil action "" and "" the insider "" .",2,1
640,"her name , of course , is erin brockovich ( julia roberts ) , and when we meet her in the opening scenes of this film , she's just a struggling single mother who has failed to win a personal injury settlement .",1,1
641,"the minor elements of buddhism ( the religion usually depicted in anime ) have been removed : where in the original the older sister prays at a shrine to let them take shelter from the rain there , she now asks , "" would it be all right if we stay here ? """,1,1
642,"one thing which particularly relieves me is that carl macek didn't pull any of his usual "" hide-the-kanji-at-all-costs "" tricks which so often make the opening credits of movies he dubs look like crud .",1,2
643,"( in order to hide the japanese symbols in the castle of cagliostro opening credits , for example , he slowed down the opening animation and reframed parts of the picture , and it looked utterly disgusting . )",0,1
644,"and now i've reached the point where , in summing up , i'm probably supposed to draw upon those phrases that have become cliches by virtue of repeated use in magazine movie reviews and inclusion on the backs of video boxes .",0,1
645,"instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding .",2,1
646,"on the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real .",1,1
647,"petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties .",2,2
648,"the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' .",0,1
649,"with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality .",1,2
650,"even though the omnipresent disco score becomes annoying and the ski slope chase scene at the beginning is blue screen technology at its worst , there are still more than enough gadgets , explosions , chases , etc .",2,2
651,"when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes .",1,1
652,"standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) .",1,1
653,"directed by james wong written by glen morgan , jeffrey reddick , and james wong even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection .",1,1
654,"this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) .",2,2
655,"the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie .",2,2

664,"i have never read a novel by ira levin ( who wrote the book from which this film is based ) , but levin's work has provided the basis for a number of classic science fiction and horror movies over the years , most notably rosemary's baby and the stepford wives and its inevitable sequels .",2,1
665,"yes , it is obviously an erotic thriller ( sharon stone strips naked frequently and makes out with william baldwin while a murderer runs around cancelling out his victims ) , but it is also a science fiction film .",1,1
